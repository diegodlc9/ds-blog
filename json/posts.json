This means that you can build and display components without interacting with the rest of the application, resulting in a faster and more efficient development process.\r\n\r\nStorybook works as a visual catalog of components, allowing developers to see how each component behaves in different configurations and states. In addition, it is compatible with several JavaScript libraries and frameworks, such as React, Vue, Angular, Svelte and Ember.js.\r\n\r\n### Why Tailwind CSS?\r\n\r\nThe main goal of Tailwind CSS is to enable developers to create custom designs quickly and efficiently. It is a utility-first CSS framework, which means it provides a set of low-level utility classes that can be combined to build complex designs directly in your HTML. This approach allows for greater flexibility and faster development compared to traditional CSS frameworks that offer pre-designed components.\r\n\r\n## MSC Shared Styles\r\n\r\nThe goal of making a design system is to reach as many platforms as possible as this will allow to have congruence between different developments using the same system for all projects that are developed for web and mobile.\r\n\r\n### MSC CDN\r\n\r\nWorks as the primary provider of the styles of our Design System, it is the core of the main line of design.\r\n\r\n![](./images/posts/diagram3.jpg)\r\n\r\n## About the upgrades\r\n\r\n![](./images/posts/diagram4.jpg)\r\n\r\n### The problem with storybook\r\n\r\nIt is complicated to use vanilla and storybook as it is as if we were working double for everything. \r\n\r\nCreating a component would require creating it in vanilla with tailwind, but unlike React, with vanilla you have to make a series of adjustments and recreate the component so that storybook is able to display it.\r\n\r\nWith react and other frameworks better adapted to this type of work the component is deployed directly from the component created in react, resulting in a component with html and Tailwind CSS as output even though it is built with react.\r\n\r\nBesides taking advantage of the super powers of react to make the code cleaner and being a showcase the functionality also becomes simpler and more scalable.\r\n\r\n### Component Example\r\n\r\nThis is an example for the Alphabetical Pager, it shows the difference of using, react vs vanilla and how it makes better to support and the result on the final deployed page will be the same.\r\n\r\nMaybe it will be some ways to doit with vanilla but we don´t need to create again something that already exist, and it is polished through the time.\r\n\r\n##### Alphabetic Pager\r\n![](./images/posts/alpha-pager.jpg)\r\n\r\n#####  Code Difference:\r\n\r\n<div className='flex gap-2'>\r\n  <div className='flex-1'>\r\n  <h5>HTML Code</h5>\r\n  ![](./images/posts/code1.jpg)\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div className='flex-1'>\r\n  <h5>React Code</h5>\r\n  ![](./images/posts/code2.jpg)\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>","slug":"tech-migration"}]
